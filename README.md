}
```

#### üìä What's rakun performances ?

We try to gather a lot of different torrents name format from all over the net to make **rakun** more efficient and reliable.
You can check [tests cases](https://github.com/lowlighter/rakun/tree/master/tests/cases) to see what kind of formatting is currently supported.

Below is an excerpt of tests cases which may help you to check **rakun**'s capabilities :

#### üìë Extracted informations

Below is the descriptor of the possible extreacted torrent informations.
Multiple values properties (codecs, audio, subtitles, etc.) are sorted to keep consistancy.

```typescript
/** Torrent informations. */
  interface TorrentInfos {
    //Original filename
      readonly filename:string
    //Cleaned name
      readonly name:string
    //Hash
      readonly hash?:string
    //File extension
      readonly extension?:string
    //Resolution
      readonly resolution?:string
    //Source (Bluray, DVD, etc.)
      readonly source?:string
    //Codecs
      readonly codecs?:string
    //Audio language
      readonly audio?:string
    //Subtitles language
      readonly subtitles?:string
    //Subber group (or translation group)
      readonly subber?:string
    //Website of subber
      readonly website?:string
    //Content producer/distributor
      readonly distributor?:string
    //Torrent other metadata (remux, repack, etc.)
      readonly meta?:string
    //Movie
      readonly movie?:string
    //Season
      readonly season?:string
    //Part
      readonly part?:string
    //Episode (or episode range)
      readonly episode?:string
  }
```

## üîß Under the hood

#### üß¨ ATNP's logic

Parsing follows the following workflow : 
  - An input `filename` is given
  - A loop iterates through the [collection of regexs](https://github.com/lowlighter/rakun/tree/master/src/regexs) to extract informations from given `filename`
  - At each iteration, extracted informations are removed from `filename` and [cleaners](https://github.com/lowlighter/rakun/blob/master/src/regexs/cleaners.ts) are applied to remove remnants
  - At the end of the loop, post-processors may be run for specific properties
  - Unmatched string in `filename` is considered as the cleaned title 
  - Extracted informations are returned
  
The main loop order is important, as it tries to match first what can be accurately extracted and removed early (like hash, extension, website, etc.) to ease the remaining extraction, while closely related informations (like season, parts and episode) may not be cleaned instantly to refine successive extraction.

While the aim is to reach 100% accuracy, note that this objective is impossible since there are too much outliers in naming conventions.

#### üèÖ Code quality

To ensure a quality library, code is required to pass **Onee-chan**'s judgement and fulfill a parsing accuracy of at least **90%** of defined [test cases](https://github.com/lowlighter/rakun/tree/master/tests/cases).

Pull requests may not be merged if they do not reach this standard, unless they are adding revelant tests which may reveal missed matches in current builds. Although edges cases should be integrated to challenge **rakun**, simpler cases should also be added to not biases **Onee-chan**'s evaluation.
